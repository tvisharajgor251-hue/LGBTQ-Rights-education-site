            <div class="subtitle" style="color:#ff4f4f;">Discrimination</div>
            LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination in schools, workplaces, healthcare, and public places.
            This unequal treatment affects their daily life, safety, and emotional well-being.
            Many are denied opportunities simply because of their identity.
            Such discrimination can lead to long-term psychological stress and trauma.
            In severe cases, it may also escalate to harassment or violence.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subtitle" style="color:#ff914d; ">Unemployment</div>
            Many struggle to secure stable jobs due to bias and prejudice.
            Employers may judge them unfairly, making it harder to achieve financial independence.
            Some are refused positions even when fully qualified.
            This pushes many into unstable or low-paying jobs just to survive.
            The lack of financial security affects their ability to plan for the future.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subtitle" style="color: #ffe24d;">Difficulty to Survive</div>
            Limited job opportunities, rejection by families, and lack of support make survival challenging.
            Some are forced into unsafe environments or unstable living conditions.
            Without proper resources, meeting basic needs becomes a daily struggle.
            Many face homelessness due to lack of acceptance at home.
            This constant instability affects their physical and mental health.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subtitle" style="color: #55e66c;">Unfairness & Judgement</div>
            Society often judges them based on stereotypes rather than understanding their identity.
            This constant unfairness leads to emotional stress and feelings of isolation.
            Hurtful comments or biased behaviors can deeply impact their self-esteem.
            Many struggle with fear of expressing themselves openly.
            These judgments create barriers that limit their true potential.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="subtitle" style="color: #4ccfff;">Societal Pressure</div>
            Many LGBTQ+ individuals face pressure to hide who they are to avoid criticism or danger.
            This struggle affects mental health and prevents them from living freely.
            Constantly pretending to be someone else can cause emotional exhaustion.
            The fear of being judged stops many from forming genuine relationships.
            This pressure often leads to anxiety, depression, and self-doubt.
